Introduction

The Fruit Quality Analysis project aims to develop a model that can evaluate the quality of fruits based on various features such as color, texture, and shape. This can be useful in agricultural industries for automating the process of sorting and grading fruits.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various fruit images and their corresponding quality labels. The features include color, texture, and other physical characteristics of the fruits. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Here's a README.md file template for your "Fruit Quality Analysis" project. You can customize it based on the specific details of your project.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various fruit images and their corresponding quality labels. The features include color, texture, and other physical characteristics of the fruits. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-quality-analysis.git
    Navigate to the project directory:
    cd fruit-quality-analysis

Usage

To analyze fruit quality using the provided notebooks, follow these steps:

    Open the Jupyter notebook fruits quality analysis.ipynb in the notebooks/ directory.

    Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

    The trained model can be used to predict the quality of new fruit samples.

Results

The results of the analysis, including the model's performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the results/ directory. Detailed analysis and findings are documented in the Jupyter notebook.
